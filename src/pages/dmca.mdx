**TL;DR:** We do not host any content ourselves. If we link to any website which violates copyright, contact the owner of the site in complaint.

US copyright law (the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act [DMCA]](https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/), as an amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976) grants certain rights to the holders of copyright. As we do not distribute any copyrighted content, we are not violating copyright or intellectual property. Rights to speak freely (as defined by the first amendment) also extend to the internet, as dictated by the Supreme Court in [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU) and [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._Ashcroft).

If you wish, you can send us a DMCA request regardless. You may do so via email (to [dmca@morrismotel.com](mailto:dmca@morrismotel.com)). Please include the infringing URL, source URL and a description of ownership. By submitting a DMCA request, you agree that you are providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and under penalty of perjury, you certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.
