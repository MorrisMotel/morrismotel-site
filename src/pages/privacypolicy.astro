<Page title="Privacy Policy">
	<p>Like any good motel, here at Morris Motel, discretion is our middle name. We believe privacy is a fundamental
		human right. We also believe privacy policies shouldn't require a team of lawyers to decipher, so here's how we
		operate:</p>
	<p>We do not host advertisements. We do not use cookies. We do not store IP addresses. We do collect some
		privacy-friendly analytics.</p>

	<p>For analytics, we use a very lightweight, <a href="https://github.com/nullitics/nullitics">open-source</a>,
		privacy-respecting analytics service called <a href="https://nullitics.com">Nullitics</a>. It creates a 300-byte
		GIF with three parameters: URL, referrer, screen width, and country code. For people blocking JavaScript, it
		will load a GIF without any parameters. It collects the bare
		minimum for analytics and does not track you, use cookies, or store User-Agent strings. Our analytics are
		compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, PECR, CCPA, and COPPA laws. We collect the following:</p>
	<ul>
		{collected.map(item => <li class="my-0">{item}</li> )}
	</ul>
	<p>We use this information to gauge
		how people interact with the site, and to improve the site. We don't have any information that advertisers would
		want (as we don't collect anything personally identifiable), but regardless, we do not share this data with any
		third parties.</p>
	<p>If you choose to fill out a
		contact form to reach us, the only information sent to us is the contents of the form. All forms are end-to-end
		encrypted with <a href="https://blocksurvey.io">BlockSurvey</a>. DMCA requests are also forwarded to a private
		Discord channel via webhook to ensure
		that we are notified immediately.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email at <a>contact@morrismotel.com</a>.</p>
