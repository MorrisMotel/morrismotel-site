There have been tons of reports of people who are unable to generate a Deezer ARL by following the old methods. In this article, we'll show you how to correctly generate a Deezer ARL, by modifying the previous methods. We'll also tell you why Deezer isn't the best service to rip your music from, and why/how you should do it differently.

As a refresher, the three methods used before were IBAN, BIN, and VCC. The **best** method to use is still VCC, as it works 100% of the time unless there's an issue with your provider. We officially do not recommend using the BIN method anymore, since it's a bit more sketchy than the previous methods and the success rate is incredibly low. IBAN still works, but we've made some changes to the steps used to generate an ARL using IBAN in order to have a higher success rate.

## Generate a Deezer ARL

This is using the IBAN method.

1. Enable your VPN, set to Germany. If you do not have a VPN yet, [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) offers a free plan with access to their Germany servers. We do not recommend using Windscribe for permanent use, but it'll do just fine if you don't have your own.
2. Register an account with Deezer using a gmail address. If you do not have a spare Google account to use, you can use [Tempmail](https://tempmail.dev/en/Gmail). It shouldn't ask for any verification, so you may be able to make up a random gmail address. Hotmail might work as well.
3. Sign up for Premium, using account details provided by [Outputter](https://outputter.io/full-identity/germany/). This will provide you with a fake identity located in Germany, alongside an IBAN to use. Be sure to enter the email address you generated previously, and **not** the one from Outputter. If you are unable to access Outputter, you can use [MyFakeInfo](https://www.myfakeinfo.com/identity/de-identity-info-generator.php) and [RandomIBAN](http://randomiban.com/?country=Germany) instead.
4. For the phone number, use one from [recieve-sms-free.cc](https://receive-sms-free.cc/Free-USA-Phone-Number/), located in the US. If the text does not come in or you get an error, go back and try another phone number.
